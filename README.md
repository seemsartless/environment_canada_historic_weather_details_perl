(Thoughts on adding weather data to historic Toronto photos)

Environment Canada has historic weather data, like http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/hourlydata_e.html?timeframe=1&Prov=ON&StationID=5051&mlyRange=1840-01-01%7C2006-12-01&Year=1958&Month=4&Day=18&cmdB2=Go# and I have about 1,800 historic photos with specific dates, so why not add a new table with weather data for the dates that I have, and add that information to the meta-data I already have?
